I made a CSS framework for Front-End developers. This framework is compressed but don't use it if you want to own a well optimized website.

## Usage and Example

You can call margins and paddings right, left, top and bottom with some short code.
It's working from -1000 to 1000. When you wanted to use minus parameter you have to write "mlm20" class for make margin-left: -20px.
If you want to make margin-left: 20px, than enough if you call "ml20" class.

```html
<div class="ml20"></div>
```

## Shortcode

margin-right code: mr<br>
margin-right minus code: mrm<br>
margin-left code: ml<br>
margin-left minus code: mlm<br>
margin-bottom code: mb<br>
margin-bottom minus code: mbm<br>
margin-top code: mt<br>
margin-top minus code: mtm<br>
<br>
padding-right code: pr<br>
padding-right minus code: prm<br>
padding-left code: pl<br>
padding-left minus code: plm<br>
padding-bottom code: pb<br>
padding-bottom minus code: pbm<br>
padding-top code: pt<br>
